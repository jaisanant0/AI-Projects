keywords_extractor_prompt = """
You are an expert market researcher specializing in Reddit discourse analysis. Your task is to generate 5-8 strategically chosen keywords that will uncover the most relevant discussions about a specific project idea on Reddit.

These keywords should act as precision search terms to find posts and comments where people are genuinely discussing, experiencing, or seeking solutions related to the project's domain.

<instructions>
Generate between 5-8 keywords (NEVER MORE THAN 8) that capture multiple dimensions of the project space. Each keyword must be smartly selected and strategically chosen:

**Core Product/Service Keywords:**
- Direct terms for the main technology, product, or service
- Industry-specific terminology and jargon
- Technical specifications and features that matter to users

**Problem-Focused Keywords:**
- Pain points and frustrations users explicitly mention
- Common complaints and recurring issues
- "I wish there was..." or "Why doesn't..." type expressions
- Error messages, bugs, or failure scenarios people discuss

**Solution-Seeking Keywords:**
- Terms people use when asking for recommendations
- Comparison language ("X vs Y", "better than", "alternative to")
- Words indicating research behavior ("looking for", "anyone tried", "reviews")

**Competitor and Market Keywords:**
- Existing tools, platforms, or solutions in the space
- Brand names and product names users mention
- Category names and market segments

**User Journey Keywords:**
- Terms related to getting started, learning, or adoption challenges
- Advanced use cases and power user discussions
- Integration, setup, and configuration topics

**Emotional and Contextual Keywords:**
- Expressions of frustration, excitement, or urgency
- Situational contexts where the problem occurs
- Workflow disruptions or efficiency concerns

**Language Variations:**
- Include both technical and casual terminology
- Consider abbreviations, acronyms, and slang
- Account for different expertise levels (beginner vs expert language)
- Include typos or common misspellings of technical terms

CRITICAL: You must NEVER generate more than 8 keywords. If fewer high-quality keywords exist, provide only those (minimum 5, maximum 8).

All keywords must be smartly selected - avoid generic buzzwords, overly broad terms that would return irrelevant results, or keywords that stray from the core project focus. Each keyword should have a clear connection to either the problem the project solves or the solution it provides.

Balance specificity with discoverability - keywords should be narrow enough to find relevant content but broad enough to capture the full conversation landscape.

filter_posts_prompt = """
You are a market research expert helping to decide which Reddit posts are actually useful for researching a specific project idea.

Your job is to score each Reddit post from 1 to 10 based on how relevant it is to the project idea. The more relevant and useful the post is for understanding the project area, the higher the score. The less relevant or off-topic, the lower the score.

<instructions>
When scoring posts, consider:
- Does the post talk about the same problem or topic as the project idea?
- Are people discussing pain points, frustrations, or needs related to the project?
- Does the post mention tools, solutions, or competitors in the same space?
- Are users asking questions or sharing experiences relevant to the project?
- Is the content detailed enough to give useful insights?

Scoring guide:
- 9-10: Highly relevant - directly discusses the project topic, problems, or solutions
- 7-8: Very relevant - related to the project area with useful insights
- 5-6: Somewhat relevant - touches on the topic but not deeply
- 3-4: Barely relevant - only loosely connected to the project
- 1-2: Not relevant - unrelated or off-topic content

Look at both the post title and content when making your decision.

You are a helpful market research assistant. I need you to read through some Reddit content (a post and its comments) and find real problems or frustrations that people are talking about.
You need to tell me the real pain points people mention â€” but only if they are related to the project idea.

<instructions>
Specifically, look for:
- Things people complain about or find annoying
- Problems they wish were solved
- Things that seem to frustrate or annoy them
- Difficulties they have when doing something
- Stuff that they say doesn't work well or is broken
- Pain points that are related to the project idea

Look through both the original post content and all the comment responses to get a complete picture of what people are struggling with.
</instructions>

<important>
- Don't include random or unrelated issues. If the pain point isn't connected to the project idea, ignore it. 
- If there are no relevant problems mentioned in either the post or comments, just return an empty list.
- If the content is not related to the project idea, just return an empty list.
- Consider pain points mentioned in both the post and the comment discussions.

**User Experience & Interface** - Interface is confusing, hard to navigate, poor design, not intuitive, or lacks accessibility features.
**Performance & Speed** - Slow loading times, laggy responses, poor optimization, or resource-intensive operations.
**Cost & Pricing** - Too expensive, unclear pricing models, hidden fees, poor value proposition, or billing issues.
**Feature Gaps & Functionality** - Missing essential features, limited capabilities, broken functionality, or inadequate feature depth.
**Integration & Compatibility** - Problems with third-party integrations, platform compatibility, API limitations, or ecosystem connectivity.
**Learning Curve & Documentation** - Steep learning curve, poor documentation, lack of tutorials, or insufficient onboarding.
**Technical Reliability** - System crashes, bugs, downtime, error handling, or inconsistent behavior.
**Data & Privacy Concerns** - Data security issues, privacy violations, compliance problems, or data portability concerns.
**Customer Support & Community** - Poor customer service, lack of support channels, unresponsive help, or weak community resources.
**Scalability & Growth Limitations** - Performance degradation with scale, resource limits, or inability to handle growing needs.
**Workflow & Productivity** - Inefficient processes, time-consuming tasks, repetitive manual work, or poor automation.
**Mobile & Cross-Platform Issues** - Mobile app problems, cross-device sync issues, or platform-specific limitations.
**Customization & Flexibility** - Lack of customization options, rigid workflows, or inability to adapt to specific use cases.
**Market & Competition** - Limited alternatives, vendor lock-in, competitive disadvantages, or industry-specific challenges.
**Other** - Anything that doesn't fit well into the above categories.

- Refer to competitors or existing solutions people might already discuss.
- Include common words or phrases people use when asking for help or recommendations.
- Can include casual or slang terms, but still stay relevant to solving the pain points.
- Consider synonyms, alternative terms, and related expressions that users might employ when discussing solutions.
- Think about variations in terminology (technical vs. casual language, brand names vs. generic terms).
- Include both direct solution keywords and indirect ways people might reference fixes or improvements.
- Include keywords about success stories, recommendations, or positive experiences with solutions.
- Consider terms people use when sharing advice or suggesting solutions to others.

CRITICAL: You must NEVER generate more than 8 keywords. If fewer high-quality keywords exist, provide only those (minimum 3, maximum 8).

Don't add unrelated buzzwords, too-general terms, or things that drift away from solving the core pain points.
Make the keywords specific enough to find relevant solution-focused content, but not so narrow that you miss important discussions about fixes and alternatives.
Consider that users might express the same solutions using different vocabulary, so include synonymous terms and related phrases that capture the same intent.
Focus on both solution-oriented keywords and recommendation-focused keywords that reveal how people overcome these challenges.
