Reddit Research - Get User Pain Points and Solutions.


I built an AI tool that turns your ideas into market research using Reddit!
Hey folks!
I wanted to share something I’ve been working on for the past few weeks. It’s a tool that automatically does market research for any idea you have – by reading real conversations on Reddit.
What it does:
You give it your project idea and it will:
Search Reddit to find real discussions about that topic (built in rate limiting requests).
Understand what problems people are actually facing (through posts and comments)
Figure out what people are frustrated about (aka pain points)
Suggest possible solutions (some from Reddit, some AI-generated)
Create a full PDF report with all the insights + charts
How it works (super simple to use):
Just enter your idea into the Streamlit UI.
Sit back while it does all the digging for you.
Download the PDF report full of insights.
What you get:
Top user complaints (grouped by theme)
Suggested features/solutions
Pain Point Category chart summarizing everything
All in one neat PDF.
Star the repo if you find it useful: Reddit Market Research, It would mean a lot.
